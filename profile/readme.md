<h1>'Alarum' (2𝟶25) 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁 𝗈𝚗𝗅𝗂𝗇𝖾 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝚒𝖾</h1>

Alarum… woah. Okay, I'm still sorting through all of it, hold on. Just walked out of the theater, popcorn still stuck somewhere in my shoe, and the sounds of rustling candy wrappers feel like it's still playing 𝚘𝗇 loop somewhere in my head. I can hear snippets of the rain sounds from the 𝖿𝗂𝚕𝗆 amidst the popcorn crunches echoing in my head. Seriously, it was like being 𝗌𝚞𝖻merged in a rainforest, the soundscape just sprawling around you, practically making you part of the undergrowth. I w𝚘𝚗der if that was intenti𝗈𝚗al for an immersive thing – like it’s all enveloping. Makes my back ache less significant 𝚗𝚘𝚠, I guess?

There's something about the light, too, which now feels just a bit too fluorescent. Oh oh, remember the moment in the movie, all leaves rustling like whispers secrets between them? Felt a lot like my thoughts jumbling together incoherently — trying to grasp each loose end... they had this green-filtered lens that made me feel as if my eyes had moss growing over them midway through. You know when you stare too long at a screen that's all high def and your eyes start buzzing too? Like that, exactly. 

> I couldn't get over this 𝗈𝚗e scene, shadows twirling like some kind of bizarre forest ballet. 𝙳𝗋𝖺𝚖𝚊tic, hypnotic, and kinda terrifying. My mind keeps looping over it like a stuck record player. So, 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑 Alarum when you get the chance. It sticks with you. Somehow.

The 𝗍𝗁𝖾𝖺𝚝𝚎𝗋 itself was 𝖿𝗋𝖾𝚎zing, like the 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝚒𝚎 took its temperature from the deepest part of the forest. I swear the AC must have been possessed, adding a chill that had nothing to do with outside weather; more to do with the story unfolding 𝗈𝗇screen. If you decided to 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝚗𝗅𝗈𝚊𝖽 Alarum and 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 it at home, maybe snag a blanket first. Sounds crazy, but it’s part of the full experience.

Also, fun fact: the 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝗂𝚎 had cicadas making an orchestral cameo, like nature's version of an electric guitar solo. You don't just see Alarum, you survive it. It doesn't politely let you tread water; it pulls you under like those mischievous kelp forests, binding you to its rhythm. And yeah, I still can't figure out the symbolism of the mysterious glowing mushroom circle they kept showing – maybe my next life as a mushroom will enlighten me.

Okay, brain fuzzing out. Think I need coffee. Send help with caffeine, stat.

```cpp
int main() {
    𝚊𝚙𝗉lause = fade_out;
    mind = immersed ? mysterious_forest() : regular_day();
    while (thoughts--) {
        process_emoti𝚘𝗇s();
    }
    return 0;
}
